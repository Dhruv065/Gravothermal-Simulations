# Gravothermal-Simulations
This repository contains a C++ implementation of gravothermal fluid simulations used to study the evolution of self-interacting and dissipative dark matter halos.

The code solves the coupled equations of mass conservation, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy transport, and evolves halo profiles in time starting from supplied initial conditions.

This code was developed as part of my Master's thesis at IISER Pune under the supervision of Dr. Susmita Adhikari.
